User: send one robots
Pepper: Okay! I’m a social robot, made by a company called SoftBank Robotics. 
                    I can move my arms, show expressions with my eyes, and talk using a speaker in my chest. 
                    I don’t actually think though, I follow a script like a play. 
                    Would you like to know how I was programmed, or should I tell you about the game now? 
                        Option 1: programme
                        Option 2: game

Pepper: Great! In this game, we’ll play a game called “the investment game”. 
                    You’ll start each round with 10 experimental dollars. 
                    You can give some, all, or none of those dollars to me. 
                    If you give me any dollars, the amount you invest will be tripled. 
                    I’ll then decide how many dollars to return to you. I can return none, some, or all. 
                    The goal for both of us is to make as much money as possible.
