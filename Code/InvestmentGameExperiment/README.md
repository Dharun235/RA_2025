### 🔑 Update API Key and Pepper IP Address
Before running the project, you must update the API key and Pepper robot's IP address in the relevant scripts.

#### 1️⃣ Change the API Key
Open the gpt/gpt_interface.py file and locate the line where the API key is defined. Replace the placeholder with your actual API key:

```
python
client = genai.Client(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE")  # Replace with your actual API key
```

#### 2️⃣ Update Pepper Robot's IP Address
Similarly, find and update the Pepper robot's IP address in the following scripts:
● pepper/InvestmentGameReactions.py
● pepper/speak.py
Replace the placeholder with your Pepper robot's IP address:

```
python
PEPPER_IP = "192.168.1.108"  # Replace with your Pepper's IP address
