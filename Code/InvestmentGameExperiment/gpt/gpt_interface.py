"""
This script connects to Pepper's Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and sends a text string to be spoken by Pepper.
It is designed to be run from the command line with the text to be spoken as an argument.
It uses the ALProxy class from the naoqi module to connect to Pepper's TTS system.
It initializes the TTS proxy with the IP address and port of Pepper's TTS system. 
It includes methods for different game reactions, such as starting the game, investing, thinking, and showing results."""
